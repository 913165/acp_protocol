```python
@server.agent()
async def echo1(
    input: list[Message], context: Context
) -> AsyncGenerator[RunYield, RunYieldResume]:
    """Echoes everything"""
    for message in input:
        await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
        yield {"thought": "I should echo everything"}
        await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
        yield message
```python

server.run()
The selected code defines an asynchronous agent function named `echo1` using the `@server.agent()` decorator from the `acp_sdk` library. This decorator registers the function as an agent with the `Server` instance, making it accessible as a REST endpoint.

```python
@server.agent()
async def echo1(input: list[Message], context: Context)
```
The function `echo1` takes two parameters: `input`, which is a list of `Message` objects, and `context`, which provides contextual information about the agent's execution. The function is asynchronous and returns an `AsyncGenerator` that yields `RunYield` and `RunYieldResume` objects.

Inside the function, a `for` loop iterates over each `Message` object in the `input` list. For each message, the function performs two asynchronous operations using `asyncio.sleep(0.5)` to introduce a delay of 0.5 seconds.

```python
await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
yield {"thought": "I should echo everything"}
```
The first operation yields a dictionary containing a "thought" message, simulating the agent's internal reasoning or response.

```python
await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
yield message
```
The second operation yields the original `Message` object, effectively echoing the input back to the caller.

This agent function is designed to process input messages asynchronously, introduce delays for simulated processing, and return both intermediate thoughts and the original input. The `server.run()` call at the end of the file starts the server, making the `echo1` agent available for interaction.
